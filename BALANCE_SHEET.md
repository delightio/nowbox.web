Balance of Outstanding Technical Debt on Aji API and Backend
============================================================
- *9 Hours* : Finish cucumber and rspec test on Twitter account channels.
- *2 Hours* : Hacked Tweet parser to take Hash or String should tidy up interface.
- *1 Hour* : lib/parsers/tweet.rb needs spec'ing.
- *1 Hour* : link_spec.rb is largely happy path only testing.
- *8 Hours* : Large set opts in Ruby are slow, we should either write a C module or find a way to use Redis.
- *10 Hours* : Refactor so that Aji::Video has no interaction with Youtube/Vimeo.
- *1 Hour* : Take a close look at the populate method of Twitter channels and see if it can be refactored.
- *3 Hours* : Make our own testable wrapper around YoutubeIt/Vimeo gems.
