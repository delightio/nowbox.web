    # This is the entry point for OAuth'ing to other web services for Aji users.
    # At the moment, the only supported provider is Twitter but Facebook is high
    # priority and Youtube will probably follow shortly since there's a wealth
    # of preexisting data we can use there.
    #
    # To initiate an OAuth request an Aji client must do the following. For this
    # example we are assuming the target is iOS 4 and the provider is twitter.
    #
    # 1. Open a webkitview pane and point it to
    # `http://api.nowbox.com/auth/twitter?user_id=USER_ID` with query parameter
    # `user_id` specifying the internal user_id for the current Aji user.
    # 2. The webkitview is redirected to the Twitter application authorization
    # page with our application listed.
    # 3. The user must then log in and authorize our application (server-side)
    # to access their account and tweet on their behalf.
    # 4. Pending successful authorization the view will then be redirected to
    # `http://api.nowbox.com/auth/twitter/callback`. Ideally, *as soon as* this
    # redirect is initiated, the webkit view would close or grey out but content
    # from it must be captured by the iOS app.
    # 5. `http://api.nowbox.com/auth/twitter/callback` will return an updated
    # JSON blob to the webkitview containing the updated user model.
    #
    # *Should the oauthentication fail for any reason the service will redirect
    # to `http://api.nowbox.com/auth/failure`.*
    get '/:provider/callback' do
      user = Aji::User.find_by_id params[:user_id]
