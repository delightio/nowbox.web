    # This is the entry point for OAuth'ing to other web services for Aji users.
    # At the moment, the only supported provider is Twitter but Facebook is high
    # priority and Youtube will probably follow shortly since there's a wealth
    # of preexisting data we can use there.
    #
    # To initiate an OAuth request an Aji client must do the following. For this
    # example we are assuming the target is iOS 4 and the provider is twitter.
    #
    # 1. Open a webkitview pane and point it to
    # `http://api.nowbox.com/auth/twitter?user_id=USER_ID` with query parameter
    # `user_id` specifying the internal user_id for the current Aji user.
    # 2. The webkitview is redirected to the Twitter application authorization
    # page with our application listed.
    # 3. The user must then log in and authorize our application (server-side)
    # to access their account and tweet on their behalf.
    # 4. Pending successful authorization the view will then be redirected to
    # `http://api.nowbox.com/auth/twitter/callback`. Ideally, *as soon as* this
    # redirect is initiated, the webkit view would close or grey out but content
    # from it must be captured by the iOS app.
    # 5. `http://api.nowbox.com/auth/twitter/callback` will return an updated
    # JSON blob to the webkitview containing the updated user model.
    #
    # For Facebook Authentication the process is a little more complicated since
    # Facebook doesn't pass parameters outside of the callback url, which is
    # how we pass the user's id through Twitter.
    #
    # 1. Open a webkitview and point it to `http://api.nowbox.com/auth/facebook`
    # 2. The webkitview is redirected from our app to Facebook's tablet auth
    # page.
    # 3. The user logs in and authenticates with us. Giving us permission to
    # post to their wall, access their content offline, and see friends and
    # videos.
    # 4. This is where the primary difference between Twitter and Facebook is.
    # Upon successful authentication the redirect to
    # `api.nowbox.com/auth/facebook/callback` must be intercepted before it goes
    # back to our server and have the `user_id` parameter added to the end of
    # it. The webkitview can then be closed and the iOS backend can send the
    # final url back to the server. It will look something like:
    # `http://api.nowbox.com/auth/facebook/callback?code=LONGCODE&user_id=ID`
    # 5. That url will return an updated version of the user hash when the
    # account has been added.
    #
    # *Should the oauthentication fail for any reason the service will redirect
    # to `http://api.nowbox.com/auth/failure`.*
