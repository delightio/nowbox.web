      irrational, intolerant, allied to racism and tribalism and bigotry, invested
      in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive
      toward children: organized religion ought to have a great deal on its conscience.
      There is one more charge to be added to the bill of indictment. With a necessary
      part of its collective mind, religion looks forward to the destruction of the
      world. By this I do not mean it \"looks forward\" in the purely eschatological
      sense of anticipating the end. I mean, rather, that it openly or covertly wishes
      that end occur. perhaps half aware that''s its unsupported arguments are not
      entirely persuasive, and perhaps uneasy about its own greedy accumulation of
      temporal power and wealth, religion has never ceased to proclaim the Apocalypse
      and the day of judgment. This has been a constant troupe, ever since the first
      witch doctors and shamans learned to predict eclipses and to use their half-baked
      celestial knowledge to terrify the ignorant. It stretches from the epistles
      of Saint Paul, who clearly thought and hoped that time was running out for humanity,
      through the deranged fantasies of the book of Revelation, which were at least
      memorably written by the alleged Saint John the Divine on the Greek island of
      Patmos, to the best-selling pulp-fiction Left Behind series, which, ostensibly
      \"authored\" by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, was apparently generated by
      the expedient of letting two orangutans loose on a word processor: \n\nThe blood
      continued to rise. Millions of birds flocked into the area and feasted on the
      remains...and the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out
      of the winepress, up to the horse''s bridles, for one thousand six hundred furlongs.\n\nThis
      is sheer manic relish, larded with half-quotations. More reflectively, but hardly
      less regrettably, it can be found in Julia Ward Howe''s \"Battle Hymn of the
      Republic,\" which dwells on the same winepress, and in Robert Oppenheimer''s
      murmur as he watched the first nuclear detonation at Alamagordo, New Mexico,
      and heard him self quoting the Hindu epic Bhagavad Gita: \"I am become Death,
      the destroyer of worlds.\" One of the very many connections between religious
      belief and the sinister, spoiled, selfish childhood of our species is the repressed
      desire to see everything smashed up and ruined and brought to naught.\n\n- Christopher
      Hitchens \"GOD IS NOT GREAT\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut
      the truly sinister complicity of the church came in its willingness to open
      its genealogical records to the Nazis and thereby enable them to trace the extent
      of a persons Jewish ancestry. A historian of the Catholic Church, Guenther Lewy,
      has written:\n\nThe very question of whether the [Catholic] Church should lend
      its help to the Nazi state in sorting out people of Jewish decent was never
      debated. On the contrary. \"We have always unselfishly worked for the people
      without regard to gratitude or ingratitude,\" a priest wrote in Klerusblatt
      in September 1934. \"We shall also do our best to help in this service to the
      people.\" And the co-operation of the Church in this matter continued right
      through the war years, when the price of being Jewish was no longer dismissal
      from a government job and loss of livelihood, but deportation and outright physical
      destruction.\n\nAll of this, despite the fact that the Catholic Church was in
      very real opposition to much of the Nazi platform, which was bent on curtailing
      its power. Goldhagen also reminds us that not a single German Catholic was excommunicated
      before, during, or after the war, \"after committing crimes as great as any
      in human history.\"\nThis is really an extraordinary fact. Throughout this period,
      the church continued to excommunicate theologians and scholars in droves for
      holding unorthodox views and to proscribe books by the hundreds, and yet not
      a single perpetrator of genocide - of whom there were countless examples - succeeded
      in furrowing Pope Pius XII''s censorious brow.\n\nNot a single leader of the
      Third Reich - not even Hitler himself - was ever excommunicated, Galileo was
      not absolved of heresy until 1992.\n\n- Sam Harris \"The end of Faith\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\"You
      got a genius attitude towards the Bible..... You need a child-like attitude..Its
      not that hard to understand.\" \n-youtube/nflstar37\n\n\"sicens is\ufeff bullshit\"
      \n- youtube/superEMOman1324\n\n\"Here''s a painful in your face analogy. Who
      made the right right? And made the liberal the left? Media made these terms,
      but God speaks! Right=Righteous Left=left behind...think about it!\" \n - youtube/Truthsayer57\n\n\"Evolution

      other. A claim of fact without any evidence.\" \n - youtube/matt61387"},"yt$age":{"$t":39},"yt$books":{"$t":"\"Ridicule

      ************************************** \r\nTo love. To be loved. To never forget
      your own  insignificance. To never get used to the  unspeakable violence and
      the vulgar disparity  of life around you. To seek joy in the saddest  places.
      To pursue beauty to its lair. To never  simplify what is complicated or complicate  what
      is simple. To respect strength, never  power. Above all, to watch. To try and  understand.
      To never look away. And never,  never, to forget.\r\n \r\n (Arundhati Roy)\r\n***************************\r\n**************************************\r\n
      People lose their health to make money\r\n Then lose their money to restore
      their health\r\nBy thinking anxiously about the future\r\n They forget the present
      Such that they live\r\n Neither for the present Nor the future\r\n ~\r\n They
      live as if they will never die\r\n They die as if they have never lived\r\n
      Thus, Take each day as it comes\r\n And live each moment to the fullest.\r\n
      ~\r\n We change the world\r\n not by what we say or do\r\n but as a consequence\r\n
      of what we have become\r\n \r\n (David R. Hawkins)\r\n******************************
      ****\r\n****************************** *******\r\nOne of my great failings is
      that I forget that  most people are uninterested in truth. My  second great  failing
      is that I forget that  history is taught as sacred lies. Taken together,  these
      two items make for my third great  failing: failing to see that sacred lies
      become  holy truth in the minds of men who have a  grasp of history not much
      better than the  average high school sophomore.\r\n\r\n (Gilad Atzmon)\r\n***********************\r\n\"The
      psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious,
      it happens outside, as fate. That is, when the individual remains undivided
      and does not become conscious of his inner opposite, the world must perforce
      act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves.\" \r\n(C. G. Jung)\r\n°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°\r\n******************************

      a conservative doesnt like guns, he doesn`t buy one.\r\nIf a liberal doesnt
      like guns, he wants all guns outlawed.\r\n\r\nIf a conservative is a vegetarian,
      he doesn`t eat meat.\r\nIf a liberal is a vegetarian, he wants all meat products
      banned for everyone.\r\n\r\n If a conservative sees a foreign threat, he thinks
      about how to defeat his enemy.\r\nA liberal wonders how to surrender gracefully
      and still look good.\r\n\r\nIf a conservative is homosexual, he quietly leads
      his life.\r\nIf a liberal is homosexual, he wants legislated recognition, he
      demands that everyone applaud his life-style and wants to re-define marriage
      and the family according to himself.\r\n\r\nIf a black man or Hispanic are conservative,
      they see themselves as\r\nindependently successful.\r\nTheir liberal counterparts
      see themselves as victims in need of government aid and protection.\r\n\r\nIf
      a conservative is down-and-out, he thinks about how to better his situation.\r\nA
      liberal wonders who is going to take care of him.\r\n\r\nIf a conservative doesnt
      like a talk show host, he switches channels.\r\nLiberals demand that those they
      dont like be shut down.\r\n\r\nIf a conservative is a non-believer, he doesnt
      go to church.\r\nA liberal non-believer wants any mention of God and religion
      silenced.\r\n(Unless its a foreign religion, of course!)\r\n\r\nIf a conservative
      decides he needs health care, he goes about shopping for\r\nit, or may choose
      a job that provides it.\r\nA liberal demands that the rest of us pay for his.\r\n\r\nIf
      a conservative slips and falls in a store, he gets up, laughs and is\r\nembarrassed.\r\nIf
      a liberal slips and falls, he grabs his neck, moans like hes in labor and then
      sues.\r\n\r\nIf a conservative disagrees with an argument being made, he comes
      up with a better argument to make his point.\r\nIf a liberal doesn''t like an
      argument being made, he questions the motives of the person making the argument,
      ignores the legitimacy of the argument itself, and instead attacks the person
      making the argument directly, invoking twisted inuendos which really only expose
      the liberal mind-set, the liberal tries to intimidate the person making the
      offending argument into self-sensorship and silence, and if all else fails the
      liberal sues because, according to him, offending him is a hate crime that should
      land you in prison.\r\n\r\nIf a conservative reads this, he''ll forward it so
      his friends can have a\r\ngood laugh.\r\nA liberal will delete it because he''s
      \"offended.\"\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\nThe  Governor of California
      is jogging with his dog along a nature trail. \r\n \r\nA coyote jumps out and
      attacks the Governor''s dog, then bites the Governor. \r\n \r\n \r\n1.  The
      Governor starts to intervene, but reflects upon the movie \"Bambi\" and then
      realizes he should stop because the coyote is only doing what is natural. \r\n
      \r\n2.  He calls  animal control.  Animal Control captures the coyote and bills
      \r\nthe State $200 testing it for diseases and $500 for relocating it. \r\n
      \r\n3.  He calls a veterinarian.  The vet collects the dead dog and bills the
      \r\nState $200 testing it for diseases. \r\n \r\n4. The Governor goes to the
      hospital and spends $3,500 getting checked for \r\ndiseases from the coyote
      and on getting his bite wound bandaged. \r\n \r\n5.  The running trail gets
      shut down for 6 months while Fish & Game conducts \r\na $100,000 survey to make
      sure the area is now free of dangerous animals. \r\n \r\n6.  The Governor spends
      $50,000 in state funds implementing a \"coyote \r\nawareness program\" for residents
      of the area. \r\n \r\n7.  The State Legislature spends $2 million to study how
      to better treat rabies and how to permanently eradicate the disease throughout
      the world. \r\n \r\n8.  The Governor''s security agent is fired for not stopping
      the attack. \r\nThe State spends $150,000 to hire and train a new agent with
      additional \r\nspecial training bout the nature of coyotes. \r\n \r\n9. PETA
      protests the coyote''s relocation and files a $5 million suit against  the State.
      \r\n \r\n \r\nTexas : \r\n \r\nThe Governor of Texas is jogging with his dog
      along a nature trail.  A Coyote jumps out and attacks his dog. \r\n \r\n1. The
      Governor shoots the coyote with his State-issued pistol and keeps \r\njogging.
      The Governor has spent $0.50 on a .45 ACP  hollow point cartridge. \r\n \r\n2.
      The Buzzards eat the dead coyote. \r\n\r\nAnd that, my friends, is why California
      is broke and Texas is not."},"yt$age":{"$t":30},"gd$feedLink":[{"rel":"http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#user.favorites","href":"http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/usa4july1776/favorites?v=2","countHint":74},{"rel":"http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#user.contacts","href":"http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/usa4july1776/contacts?v=2","countHint":811},{"rel":"http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#user.inbox","href":"http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/usa4july1776/inbox?v=2"},{"rel":"http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#user.playlists","href":"http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/usa4july1776/playlists?v=2"},{"rel":"http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#user.subscriptions","href":"http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/usa4july1776/subscriptions?v=2","countHint":378},{"rel":"http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#user.uploads","href":"http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/usa4july1776/uploads?v=2","countHint":8},{"rel":"http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#user.newsubscriptionvideos","href":"http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/usa4july1776/newsubscriptionvideos?v=2"}],"yt$gender":{"$t":"m"},"yt$location":{"$t":"US"},"yt$statistics":{"lastWebAccess":"2011-10-13T21:05:54.000-07:00","subscriberCount":"373","videoWatchCount":0,"viewCount":"15039","totalUploadViews":"222503"},"media$thumbnail":{"url":"http://i3.ytimg.com/i/rcJiv4ctvzkhqttGBv_tkw/1.jpg"},"yt$username":{"$t":"USA4July1776"}}}'

      EVERYONE SHOULD BE CONTACTING THEIR STATE SENATORS, STATE ASSEMBLY REPRESENTATIVES,

      generation to preserve your freedom. I hope you will make good use of it. If
      you do not, I shall repent in heaven that ever I took half the pains to preserve
      it\". (JOHN ADAMS)\r\n\r\nWE NOW HAVE 20 THOUSANDS TROOPS STATIONED IN THE UNITED
      STATES TO STOP \"CIVIL UNREST\"\r\n\r\nI WOULD RATHER VOTE FOR SOMEONE I BELIEVE
      IN AND LOSE, THAN VOTE FOR SOMEONE I DONT BELIEVE IN AND WIN, FOR THAT ONE WILL
      SURELY BETRAY ME\r\n\r\nWE CAN HAVE DEMOCRACY OR WE CAN HAVE THE POWER IN THE
      HANDS OF A FEW, BUT WE CAN NOT HAVE BOTH\r\n\r\nOBAMA IS A TROJAN HORSE\r\nHE

      that will dissolve our constitution\r\n\r\nBiden was LEAD author of the Bill
      that limited the rights of individuals to use bankruptcy as a means of eliminating
      credit card debt (he is from Delaware where many banks have incorporated)\r\nTHIS
      IS THE SAME BILL THAT OBAMA ATTACKED H CLINTON FOR VOTING FOR\r\nAND THE SAME
      BILL THAT HE CALLED THE GREATEST SPECIAL INTEREST TRAVESTY EVER\r\nPERPETRATED
      ON THE AMERICAN WORKING CLASS AND MIDDLE CLASS\r\nBiden led the charge on the
      Iraq war declaring he believed there were weapons of mass destruction(AFTER
      reviewing the intelligence made available to George Bush)\r\nBiden was the most
      vocal Democratic advocate of the War.\r\nBiden also voted for the patriot act\r\nBiden
      said he would be PROUD TO RUN ON THE SAME TICKET WITH JOHN MCCAIN in 2000 and
